### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
##LUIS EDUARDO JIMENEZ DIAZ

I am an international student pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering at **Cal State LA**. I did my bachelors in Mexico at **Universidad Autonoma de Aguascalientes**, with a major in `Biomedical Engineering`. Before coming to Cal State LA, I used to work as Service Engineer giving preventive and corrective maintenance to biomedical equipment. I am also vice president of a student organization, BMES (_Biomedical Engineering Society_), and my current research focuses on TMS (_Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation_) / EEG analysis.
